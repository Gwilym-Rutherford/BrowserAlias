Have you ever seen [DuckDuckGo bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) notation? well this is that merged with some features I wanted personally.

## Features
1. bang like functionality\
   **example usage:**

   | `gh Gwilym-Rutherford/BrowserAlias` |    `https://github.com/Gwilym-Rutherford/BrowserAlias`      |

2. instant search

  When searching very common websites that don't require another input you can set the option to instant search.
  This means that it will automatically redirect you to the desired page as soon as it detects a valid alias.
